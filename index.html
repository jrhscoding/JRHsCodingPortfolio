            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello World! My name is Joseph Hernandez and I am relatively new to web development. I would say I began
                my coding journey a number of years ago when I first booted up the <a
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> website and tried my hand at learning some
                html. Since then I've remained in my current career but decided to make the leap in pursuing web
                development in earnest. Below you will find a collection of the projects I have completed as well as
                some fun images from my personal life. I hope to develop a career in web development and am excited to
                see my portfolio grow.</p>
